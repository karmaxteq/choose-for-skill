# TypeScript/JavaScript Development Skill

Autonomous Development Workflow

## Linting and Formatting

-**Lint:**`yarn lint-eslint-pure`

- Run ESLint on the codebase

-**Format:**`yarn prettier`

- Format code using Prettier

-**Type Check:**`yarn type-check-pure`

- Run TypeScript type checking

## Testing

### JavaScript/TypeScript Tests

-**Test a specific file:**`yarn test-unit-keep-cljs path/to/file.unit.spec.js`

-**Test by pattern:**`yarn test-unit-keep-cljs -t "pattern"`

- Runs tests matching the given pattern

### ClojureScript Tests

-**Test ClojureScript:**`yarn test-cljs`

- Run ClojureScript tests

- Do not attempt to read or edit files outside the project folder
- Add failing tests first, then fix them
- Work autonomously in small, testable increments
- Run targeted tests, and lint continuously during development
- Prioritize understanding existing patterns before implementing
- Don't commit changes, leave it for the user to review and make commits
